# Crowdfunding ETL Process

The purpose of this assignment was to use the ETL process to clean, organize, and store data that was given to us using crowdfunding information.

## Data Cleaning Process and Storing process

The information given was a CSV files with "backer" information that included their name, emails, and crowdfunding ID. The backer CSV file was converted to a more organized and readable dataframe. A written ERD was then created to establish relationships between the new backer table and the tables that were already included in thee database. Primary and Foreign keys were identified and data types were properly labeled.

The new data was imported into a Postgres Database. Using SQL queries new tables were created with information including backer and contact emails and crowdfunding goal amounts and how much of that goal was left.
